# ResNet_Classification_model

This project is a simple implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet architecture for classifying dog emotions into four categories: 'Happy,' 'Angry,' 'Relaxed,' and 'Sad.' It was developed as a part of a college project and is not intended for any production-grade use. 

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to gain familiarity with Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically utilizing the ResNet model, as it was the first attempt at working with CNNs. The model's accuracy is acknowledged to be low and requires further improvement. 

## Model Improvement

Fine-tuning techniques were applied to enhance the model's performance. However, it's important to note that due to the limited scope and time constraints of this project, the model's performance may not be optimal.

## Data Source

The dataset used for training and testing the model was acquired from Kaggle. As part of the learning process, this dataset was employed to train the model to recognize emotions in dogs.

Please note that this project serves as a learning experience and is not intended for robust or real-world applications. 

### Acknowledgment

The implementation follows best practices and guidelines, considering the academic context in which it was developed.
